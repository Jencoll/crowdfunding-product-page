## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was really interesting for me because I learned a lot when working on the JavaScript part. How to think like the computer was challenging but at the end, I was more confident.



### Continued development

I want to focus on projects with more elaborate JavaScript parts so I can gain more and more confidence using this language.

Also, in the next projects, I think it would be good to build with mobile-first in mind.
